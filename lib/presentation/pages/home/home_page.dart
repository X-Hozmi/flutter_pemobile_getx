Basically, the automation of CI/CD helps you create better code more quickly and securely. In this article, Iâ€™ll describe what CI/CD means, the CI/CD pipeline workflow, the benefits, how to implement a good CI/CD pipeline, and how CI/CD fits into the DevOps universe.';

  CI/CD is the acronym for the words Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment which are modern development techniques that help optimize software development processes. The CI/CD process involves automatically integrating code updates from several developers into a single codebase.

  Using CI/CD, teams can provide updates to their code more frequently and coherently, and errors are found earlier. Thus the coding, testing, and development procedures have been streamlined thanks to CI/CD.
